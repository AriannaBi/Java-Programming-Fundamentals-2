						- Black Pearl -

- Place your 6 ships on the grid : you will have 2 ships of 2 size, 2 ships of 3 size and other 2 ships of 4 size. (Each size is 			represented by one block of the grid).
- An array will represent the grid, and the array value 1 or 0 represent if there is a ship on that cell or not (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- You cannot sovrappose two ships, and so the opponent.
- The opponent will place in random position its 6 ships on to the grid.
- You can place them vertically or horizontally.
- If you get the right place where the opponent ship is located, you get 1 point  and the grid should show an X on that grid.
